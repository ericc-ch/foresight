Okay, here's a detailed specification for your simple, AI-powered note-taking application, similar to Google Keep:

# Simple Notes with AI: Application Specification

**1. Overview**

This document outlines the specifications for a simple and focused note-taking application built using React and incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) features to enhance the user experience. The application will present notes in an easily scannable grid layout, with each note card offering AI-powered functionalities for cover image generation, tag generation, and grammar correction.

**2. Core Functionality**

*   **Note Creation:** Users can quickly create new text-based notes.
*   **Note Display:** Notes are displayed on the main screen in a dynamic, grid-like pattern.
*   **Note Editing:** Users can edit the content of existing notes.
*   **Note Deletion:** Users can delete notes.
*   **Search:** Users can search through their notes.
*   **AI Enhancement:** Each note card features AI capabilities for image generation, tag generation, and grammar correction.

**3. User Interface (UI) Components and Layout**

The application will primarily utilize KendoReact Free components to build a clean and intuitive user interface.

*   **Main Screen:**
    *   **App Bar:** (`AppBar` component)

        *   Placeholder image or background color if no cover image has been generated or is loading.
    *   **Note Content Snippet:** (`CardBody` component with `Typography` or basic HTML elements)
        *   Displays a concise preview of the note's text content (e.g., the first few lines).
    *   **AI Action Buttons:** (`CardActions` component or a `div` with `Button` components)
        *   **Generate Cover Image Button:** (`Button` component with an icon). Triggers the AI to generate a cover image.
        *   **Generate Tags Button:** (`Button` component with an icon). Triggers the AI to generate tags.
        *   **Fix Grammar Button:** (`Button` component with an icon). Triggers the AI to correct the grammar in the note.
    *   **Tags Area:** (`CardFooter` component or `CardBody` with `ChipList` component)
        *   Displays AI-generated tags as `Chip` components.
    *   **Delete Button:** (`Button` component or an icon within the `CardHeader` or `CardActions`). Allows users to delete the note.
*   **New/Edit Note Screen:**
    *   **App Bar:** (`AppBar` component)
        *   **Title:** Displays "New Note" or "Edit Note".
        *   **Save Button:** (`Button` component). Saves the note content.
        *   **Back Button:** (`Button` component or an icon). Navigates back to the main screen.
    *   **Title Input:** (`Input` component) (Optional) Allows users to add a title to the note.
    *   **Note Body:** (`TextArea` component) Allows users to input or edit the main content of the note.
*   **Confirmation Dialog:** (`Dialog` or `Window` component)
    *   Used to confirm note deletion.
    *   Displays a message like "Are you sure you want to delete this note?".
    *   "Confirm" and "Cancel" buttons (`Button` components).
*   **Loading Indicator:** (`Loader` component)
    *   Displayed when AI operations (image generation, tag generation, grammar correction) are in progress.

**4. Detailed Feature Specifications**

*   **4.1. Note Creation:**
    *   Clicking the "New Note" button will navigate the user to the New/Edit Note screen with an empty `TextArea`.
    *   Users can type their note content into the `TextArea`.
    *   Users can optionally add a title using the `Input` field.
    *   Clicking the "Save" button will save the note and navigate back to the main screen.

*   **4.2. Note Display:**
    *   Upon loading the application, all saved notes will be fetched and displayed in the grid layout.
    *   Each note will be rendered as a `Card` with a preview of its content.

*   **4.3. Note Editing:**
    *   Clicking on a note `Card` in the grid will navigate the user to the New/Edit Note screen, pre-filled with the selected note's title and content.
    *   Users can modify the content in the `TextArea` and the title in the `Input` field.
    *   Clicking the "Save" button will update the note and navigate back to the main screen.

*   **4.4. Note Deletion:**
    *   Clicking the "Delete" button on a note `Card` will trigger the confirmation dialog.
    *   If the user confirms, the note will be permanently deleted, and the main screen will be updated.

*   **4.5. Search:**
    *   As the user types in the search `Input` in the `AppBar`, the note grid will dynamically filter to display only notes whose title or content contains the search query.

*   **4.6. AI-Powered Features (Per Note Card):**
    *   **4.6.1. Generate Cover Image:**
        *   Clicking the "Generate Cover Image" button will:
            *   Display a loading indicator on the button or cover image area.
            *   Send the note's content (and optionally the title) to an image generation API (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI).
            *   Upon receiving the generated image URL, update the `CardImage` (or background image) of the note card.
            *   Remove the loading indicator.
    *   **4.6.2. Generate Tags:**
        *   Clicking the "Generate Tags" button will:
            *   Display a loading indicator on the button or tags area.
            *   Send the note's content to an LLM API (e.g., Google Gemini, OpenAI) to extract relevant keywords or phrases as tags.
            *   Upon receiving the generated tags, display them as `Chip` components in the note card's footer or body.
            *   Remove the loading indicator.
    *   **4.6.3. Fix Grammar:**
        *   Clicking the "Fix Grammar" button will:
            *   Display a loading indicator on the button.
            *   Send the full content of the note to a grammar correction API (e.g., Grammarly API, LanguageTool API).
            *   Upon receiving the corrected text:
                *   If the user is currently viewing the note on the main screen, update the displayed snippet.
                *   If the user is currently editing the note on the New/Edit Note screen, update the content of the `TextArea`.
            *   Remove the loading indicator.
