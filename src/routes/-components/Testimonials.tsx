                  "Finally, a stack that lets me focus on building instead of
                  configuring. I used to spend weeks setting up my dev
                  environment. Now, with this stack, I spend weeks... actually
                  building things! It's revolutionary! My productivity has
                  increased by at least 300%, or maybe I'm just finally getting
                  enough sleep."

                  I tried it. And my life changed. Birds started singing, the
                  sun shone brighter, and my sourdough starter finally rose.
                  Coincidence? I think not."

                  Just kidding! But for my side project, it's been amazing. So
                  simple, so fast. I actually launched something! My therapist
